# Frontend Requirements
# No additional Python packages needed - uses built-in http.server
# The frontend is pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript

# However, to run the complete system you need:
# 1. FastAPI backend (install from root requirements.txt)
# 2. Ollama (install separately from https://ollama.com)
# 3. Llama 3.2 Vision model (ollama pull llama3.2-vision:11b)
