The document contains information to implement Deep Learning (DL) applications using Keras, Mosquitto and Docker libraries.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Keras

Keras is a deep learning library for Python.

Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are kind of neural networks that is useful for modeling sequence data such as time series.
