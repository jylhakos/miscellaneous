# Microservices and Deep Learning

The document contains information to implement Deep Learning (DL) applications using Keras, Mosquitto and Docker libraries.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Keras

Keras is a deep learning library for Python.

Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are kind of neural networks that is useful for modeling sequence data such as time series.

Time Series prediction using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks in Python with Keras

A neural network does a forward pass and computes the prediction errors to obtain the loss values on the training dataset and on the validation set.

The gradient descent refers to the search for a global minimum by evaluating the partial derivatives.

The neural network seeks to minimize the error by adjusting its internal weights during training.

Backpropagation calculates the partial derivatives of the error with respect to the weights.

The loss or error measures the prediction error of the network as a number.

Then the RNN resets the weights, up or down, based on the partial derivatives.
