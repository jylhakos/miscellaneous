# Traversing an undirected graph

An undirected graph defined as G=(N,E) consists of a set of nodes N and set E of edges which are unordered pairs of elements of N.

## Depth first search (DFS)

DFS traverses nodes in a graph by expanding every node it locates in a recurrent manner.

## Breadth first search (BFS)

BFS uses queue data structure for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

## Dijkstra’s

Dijkstra’s algorithm finds the lengths of the shortest paths from the start node to all the other nodes in the graph.
