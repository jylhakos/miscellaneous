# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Guide

## Introduction to AI
Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

## Machine Learning Fundamentals
Machine Learning (ML) is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

### Types of Machine Learning:
1. **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled data
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction with environment

## Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that's inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, specifically neural networks. Deep learning uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to model and understand complex patterns in data.

### Applications of Deep Learning:
- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis

## Meta Llama 4 Scout
Meta Llama 4 Scout represents the latest advancement in large language models, featuring:
- Enhanced reasoning capabilities
- Better instruction following
- Improved context understanding
- Efficient quantized versions (4-bit and 8-bit)
- Optimized for RAG applications

## Vector Databases in AI
Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors efficiently. They are crucial for:
- Semantic search applications
- Recommendation systems
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems
- Similarity matching

## RAG Systems
Retrieval-Augmented Generation combines the power of large language models with the ability to retrieve relevant information from external knowledge bases, resulting in more accurate and contextually relevant responses.
