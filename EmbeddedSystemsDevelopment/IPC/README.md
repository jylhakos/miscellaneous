# Embedded Software Development - Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

## Overview

Inter-Process Communication (IPC) refers to mechanisms that allow processes to communicate and synchronize their actions. In embedded systems, IPC is crucial for coordinating multiple processes or threads, enabling data sharing, and implementing distributed system architectures.

## IPC Mechanisms

### 1. Traditional UNIX IPC

#### Pipes and Named Pipes (FIFOs)
- **Pipes**: Unidirectional communication channels between related processes
- **Named Pipes (FIFOs)**: Bidirectional communication between unrelated processes
- Suitable for simple data streaming between processes

#### System V IPC
- **Message Queues**: Structured message passing with priority support
- **Shared Memory**: High-performance data sharing through common memory segments
- **Semaphores**: Synchronization primitives for resource management

#### POSIX IPC
- Modern standardized IPC mechanisms
- **POSIX Message Queues**: Improved message passing with better performance
- **POSIX Shared Memory**: Memory-mapped files for inter-process data sharing
- **POSIX Semaphores**: Thread-safe synchronization primitives

### 2. Network-Based IPC

#### Sockets
- **UNIX Domain Sockets**: Local communication with socket interface
- **TCP/UDP Sockets**: Network communication across machines
- **Raw Sockets**: Low-level network protocol access

## Modern IPC Solutions

### D-Bus
D-Bus is an interprocess communication standard (IPC) that enables different processes to communicate with each other using:
- **Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)**: One-to-one communication
- **Signals**: One-to-many communication for broadcasting events
- Commonly used in desktop Linux environments for system service communication

### Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT)
MQTT is a publish/subscribe messaging protocol known for its lightweight nature and efficiency, particularly suitable for:
- **IoT Applications**: Low-bandwidth, high-latency networks
- **Process-to-Process Communication**: Through a central broker (like Mosquitto)
- **Embedded Systems**: Minimal overhead and resource usage

Key characteristics:
- Lightweight and efficient
- Publish/subscribe model
- Quality of Service (QoS) levels
- Retain messages and persistent sessions

#### Mosquitto MQTT Broker
Once Mosquitto is included in a Linux build, C/C++ MQTT clients can be used for:
- Inter-process messaging through the broker
- Distributed system communication
- Event-driven architectures

### ZeroMQ (0MQ)
ZeroMQ is an asynchronous messaging library that provides various socket types for different communication patterns:

#### Communication Patterns
- **Publish-Subscribe (pub-sub)**: One-to-many messaging
- **Request-Reply**: Synchronous request-response pattern
- **Push-Pull**: Load distribution and fan-out patterns
- **Pair**: Exclusive pair communication

#### Transport Options
- **In-process (inproc)**: Thread-to-thread communication
- **Inter-process (ipc)**: Process-to-process on same machine
- **TCP**: Network communication
- **Multicast**: Group communication

#### Advantages
- High performance and low latency
- No broker required (brokerless)
- Language agnostic
- Built-in patterns for common messaging scenarios

## QNX IPC

QNX provides a comprehensive set of IPC mechanisms optimized for real-time embedded systems:

### Message Passing
- Native QNX message passing with guaranteed delivery
- Synchronous and asynchronous communication modes
- Priority inheritance for real-time scheduling

### Pulses
- Lightweight asynchronous notifications

- Integration with QNX kernel scheduling

### Shared Memory
